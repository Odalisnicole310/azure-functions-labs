# Azure Functions — HTTP Trigger (Python)

In this lab, I built and deployed a serverless HTTP-triggered Azure Function using Python.

The goal of this project was to understand how Azure Functions work, how triggers are used, and how serverless applications run without managing servers.

## What I did

- Created a Function App in Azure (Consumption plan)
- Used an HTTP trigger
- Wrote the function in Python
- Deployed directly from the Azure Portal
- Tested the function using the generated URL
- Verified successful execution ("Hello World from Azure Functions!")

## What I learned

This project helped me understand:

- What **serverless** really means
- How **triggers** and **bindings** work
- How Azure handles scaling automatically
- How functions are deployed and tested in real environments

These are core concepts used in real Cloud Engineer roles.

## Proof

See the screenshot in this repo showing the successful function execution.
